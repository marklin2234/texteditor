# Text Editor

This text editor is created using FLTK GC++ UI toolkit. We want our text editor to achieve the following functions:

1. Provide a menubar/menus for all functions.
2. Edit a single text file, possibly with multiple views.
3. Load from a file.
4. Save to a file.
5. Cut/copy/delete/paste functions.
6. Search and replace functions.
7. Keep track of when the file has been changed.


## Installation
Download the executable `editor.app`.

Run the desktop application to run the editor.
